## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a microservices architecture. Each service is independently deployable and communicates with others through well-defined APIs.

## Features

- Modular microservices structure
- Isolated codebases for each service
- Easy local development and deployment (Docker-compatible)
- Environment variable configuration

## Tech Stack

- Language(s): _[Add your main languages, e.g., Node.js, Python, C#]_
- Framework(s): _[Express, FastAPI, .NET, etc.]_
- Docker for containerization
- API-driven communication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed (recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Any language-specific requirements (Node, Python, .NET SDK, etc.)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyonn19/MicroServices.git
cd MicroServices
```

## Running Locally

You can run the microservices using Docker Compose (if provided):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Or, run each service individually by navigating into its folder and following the service-specific instructions.

_Example:_

```bash
cd service-one
# Follow README or instructions for that service
```

### Environment Variables

Each service may require certain environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the relevant service directory and fill in the values.

## API Endpoints

Each microservice exposes its own set of endpoints. Please refer to the documentation or code in each serviceâ€™s directory for more details.

## Testing

To run tests for a given service, navigate to its directory and follow its test instructions. Common commands include:

```bash
# Node.js example
npm test

# Python example
pytest
```

## Deployment

You can deploy the services individually or as a group using Docker or orchestration tools like Kubernetes. Update environment variables and configuration as needed for your production environment.
